distracted doing the &di dishes they did something they probably should not have done	0
and they got the kitchen stool and moved it under the cupboard where the cookie jar was and the young boy climbed up to get a cookie .	0
&um because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool he's	0
about to fall and probably hurt himself (be)cause his head's gonna hit the kitchen cupboards	0

&um the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside	0
the water is running in the sink	0

maybe that was an apron and um maybe this was the um	1
there is this this should be a window .	1
there the upper one is there	1
uh it um has a pathway	1
uh we don't know where the pathway is going to because we can't see it down below	1

and the mother's in the kitchen running the water at the sink .	1
and the water's running over and it's all over the floor	1
and there are curtains at the windows	1

leading to a garage it looks like	1
and there are curtains there	1
and &uh that's about all there	1
well the girl is telling the boy to get the cookies down but don't	1
tell your mother	1
and the boy is also falling over off the stool	1
and the mother is letting the water run out_of the sink	1
and she's dryin(g) dishes	1
I don't quite get that but then &=laughs	1
&uh she has water on the floor and [/] and basically it's kind_of	1
&uh a distressing scene	1
everything's goin(g) haywire	1
she needs to turn off the water	1
if she turned off the water she'd be a hundred percent better off	1
oh boy	1
wowie the boy's going up on a cookie+jar [: stool] [* s:r] to get	1
cookies and he's falling off the jar [: stool] [* s:r] and his	1
sister is just wondering about it	1
will he hit the bottom ?	1
mama has an [//] &ov a sink that's overrunning with [/] with &uh	1
water splashin(g) down onto her shoes	1
she's in the process of drying dishes	1
she's looking out an open window at the same time	1
the cookie jar is open	1
and the girl has her finger to her lips	1
well let me see .	1
&uh everything that's going to happen, huh ?	1
looking out the window <maybe it> [//] I don't know if it's &uh the	1
breeze blowin(g) the curtains because uh <the curtains look a little	1
wee bit> [//] &th <over the> [/] <over the window blind> [//] over	1
the window they look a little wee bit puffy	1
so maybe there's a slight breeze coming <in the> [/] in the kitchen	1
window	1
the scene is <in the> [/] in the kitchen	0
the mother is wiping dishes and the water is running on the floor	0
a child is tryinto geta boy is tryin to get cookies outta out of a jar and he's about to tip over on a stool	0
&uh the little girl is reacting to his falling .	0
&uh it seems to be summer out	0
the window is open	0
the curtains are blowing	0
it must be a gentle breeze	0
there's grass outside in the garden	0
&uh mother's finished certain of the [/] the dishes	0
kitchen's very tidy	0
the mother seems to have nothing in the house to eat except cookies	0
in the cookie jar	0
&uh the children look to be almost about the same size	0
perhaps they're twins	0
they're dressed for summer warm weather	0
&um you want more	0
the mother's in a short sleeve dress	0
I'll hafta say it's warm	0
oh I see the sink is running over	0
I see the stool is tipping over	0
little boy's trying to get cookies out	0
the girl is reaching to get a cookie	0
the mother is drying dishes	0
the window's open	0
that's what she's washing> [//] oh she's drying dishes now	0
she's standing in the water	0
the brother's leaning against the cookie jar	0
curtains on the window	0
there's some grass and some shrubbery outside the house next door	0
kitchen cabinets	0
oh I see three people in there, a mother and little boy and a girl	0
&um a boy and a girl are in the kitchen with their mother .	0
and the little boy is getting a cookie for the little girl but he's	0
on a stool it's about to fall down .	0
&uh the mother is washing dishes	0
and she's obviously thinking of something else because the water's	0
pouring out over the &uh sink .	0
she's finished with some of the dishes .	0
it seems to be summertime because there are bushes	0
the window is open .	0
there seems to be some kind of a breeze because the curtains on the sill there blowing .	0
must be fairly hot	0
the mother's in a sleeveless dress .	0
the children are in [/] in short sleeve &um tops and have sandals .	0
the little boy has &uh tennis shoes on .	0
&um the mother obviously is unaware of what the children are doing	0
she's going to be aware of it very shortly &um I_mean how much more do you want ?	0
it was summertime and mother and the children were working in the kitchen	0
and the window was open and there was a slight breeze blowing in .	0
um mother was daydreaming and forgot and left the water in the sink running and it was overflowing	0
&um the children were hungry and because they knew mother was	0
distracted doing the &di dishes they did something they probably should not have done	0
and they got the kitchen stool and moved it under the cupboard where the cookie jar was and the young boy climbed up to get a cookie .	0
&um because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool he's	0
about to fall and probably hurt himself (be)cause his head's gonna hit the kitchen cupboards	0
&um it looks like the house is set in the country	0

in other words it's &uh	1
&uh she [/] she's deciding that if she did see them she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it	1
but I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling	1
I think she would have turned	1
maybe dropped her dish &=laughs	1
but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being	1
harmed in the fall	1
and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too	1
and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor &=laughs it would be a sad	1
 +, threesome but [//] and the kitchen would be a mess	1
oh my	1
you mean how much or just &t the ones ?	1
there's [//] the sink is overflowing while she's wiping &uh &uh &k &uh a plate and not looking &=laughs	1
the little boy is hungry	1
he wants to get some cookies	1
and he's standing on &uh &um a stool	1
and it's tipping over	1
and I don't know whether he's gonna bring the cookie jar with him or what &=laughs	1
and the little girl is &um &uh holding up her hand wanting some	1
and he's gonna give to him	1
but &uh I don't know if she has a finger to her mouth but	1
and she knows that he's gonna be tipping over it looks like to me	1
or maybe she's just not noticing it and making her mouth get ready for this good cookie	1
I don't know which way it is for the little girl	1
(be)cause she's smiling	1
I think if she saw him falling over she'd do something to [/] to help him so he wouldn't get hurt	1
I_mean she'd grab it or something .	1
but she's just looking up at him you_know lookin(g) up at those good cookies and waitin(g) for them to come to her hand	1
but this little finger in her mouth is	1
&uh I'm not quite sure what it means	1
and &uh I don't know whether the mother knows this is wet yet &=laughs .	1
